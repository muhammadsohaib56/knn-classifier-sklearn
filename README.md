# 🤖 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification


````markdown

This project demonstrates the use of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for solving a classification problem. It includes end-to-end implementation from data preprocessing to evaluation and visualization using `scikit-learn`.

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## 🧠 What is KNN?

**KNN** is a **non-parametric**, **lazy learning** algorithm used for classification and regression. It classifies new instances based on the **majority vote of their k nearest neighbors** in the feature space.

## 📊 Project Highlights

* ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
* 🔍 Train-Test Split using `train_test_split`
* 🧪 Model Training with `KNeighborsClassifier`
* 📈 Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix
* 📉 Hyperparameter tuning (optional)

---

## 📈 Output & Visualizations

* Confusion matrix heatmap
* Decision boundaries (optional)
* Accuracy scores at different `k` values

---

## ✅ Results
